Hello! I'm Nick, a Welsh language student. This is a page I've
set up to use as a diary for practice. I'm currently at the
entry level, Mynediad, so much of this will probably be basic
and repetetive. But I also hope I can use it as a record of the
progress I'm making as I move on to higher levels.
